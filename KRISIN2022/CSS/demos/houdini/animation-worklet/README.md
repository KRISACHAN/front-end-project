# Animation Worklet Samples

Samples for the [AnimationWorklet specification](https://wicg.github.io/animation-worklet/) of the [Houdini task force].

[Houdini task force]: https://wiki.css-houdini.org/

You can find all Houdini samples from [this link](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/houdini-samples/).

Each sample has its own folder with a demo implemented using a [polyfill of the AnimationWorklet API](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/houdini-samples/blob/master/animation-worklet/anim-worklet.js).
When there is native support in browsers for AnimationWorklet, these samples will be able to run on a separate thread free
from main thread jank.
