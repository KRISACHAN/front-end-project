    <p>Ought not you, children, to be more covered over than you are? Jack, instead of being so entirely wrapped up in yourself, suppose you pay a little attention to your sister, and wrap her up in those warm eiderdown rugs I purchased in Norway. Dear me! How could I possibly have forgotten it? I have just the thing to make us all comfortable. Do you see this round thing, something like a china cannonball? It is called The Chilly-warmer. I take two small bottles of a chemical preparation that I carry in my pocket, and pour a few drops of each into these two tiny holes you see at the side. These liquids meet together inside the apparatus, and immediately, by their action one upon another, they make the Chilly-warmer so warm, that even at a good distance off you can feel it like a cosy fire.</p>
